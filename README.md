Description of the project
A console application is like a chat or conversation between you and your computer. You can give it simple commands, and it does what you ask.In simple terms, we are creating a computer program that helps manage information. You can tell it what to do using text commands, and it will save and retrieve this information in a storage system to make sure everything works smoothly and can change things easily if needed.

Description of a command Interpreter:
A command interpreter, or shell, is a program that provides a command-line interface for interacting with a computer or software system.
It reads user-entered text commands, interprets them, and executes corresponding actions.

How to Start a Command Interpreter:
The method to start a command interpreter depends on your operating system:
On Windows, you can start the Command Prompt by searching for "cmd" or "Command Prompt" in the Start menu or by pressing Win + R, typing "cmd," and pressing Enter. PowerShell can be started similarly by searching for "PowerShell."
On macOS, you can start the Terminal by searching for it in the Applications folder or by using Spotlight Search (Cmd + Space).
On Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux), you can typically open a terminal emulator like GNOME Terminal, Konsole, or xterm. You can also use the default terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T or searching for "Terminal" in the applications menu.

How to Use a Command Interpreter:
Once the command interpreter is open, you'll see a text-based prompt where you can type commands.
To execute a command, type it and press Enter.
Commands often consist of a command name followed by options and arguments, separated by spaces.
You can use various special characters for input/output redirection, piping, and more.
